### Business Task

The problem I am solving with the case study is identifying how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. These insights will then be used to drive business decisions, primarly through the development of a marketing campaign aimed at converting existing casual riders to annual members. Key stakeholders include the other members of the Cyclistic marketing analytics team, the director of marketing, and the Cyclistic executive team.
